# Welcome!

This is my public profile and contains any personal project that may
be relevant to anyone. Projects that might receive collaboration are
mostly found in my organization,
[@psiwray-corp](https://github.com/psiwray-corp).
Some of the projects usually stay hidden until I decide that they've
reached a mature point and will then become public.
