# Welcome!

This is my public profile and contains any personal project that may
be relevant to anyone. Projects that might receive collaboration are
mostly found in my organization, [@psiwray-com](https://github.com/psiwray-com).

Some of the projects usually stay hidden until I decide that they've
reached a mature point and will then become public.
